# HW04Jh5764a

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of HW04Jh5764a is to gain information about data frames. Function 1 allows you to get the names of each variable in a
data set, allows you to get the class of each variable, allows you to find the number of unique data points in each variable and allows you to find the number of NA's in each variable. Function 2 Allows you to visualize the distribution and density of the data in each variable in a given data frame. It works by taking a specific class as an input and then returns a histogram or bar plot of the all of the variables of the specific class. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of HW04Jh5764a like so:

This package is only available by permission of the author on my github repo using the install_github() function
from the (devtools) package.



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub.
